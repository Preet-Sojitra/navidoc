## Team Name: _NoTeXe_

## Category: Health Care

## Problem Statement

There are moments when people are **_confused_** about whether the symptoms they are suffering from are _severe_ or not. This confusion can lead to the worsening of their mental as well as physical health and it needs to be resolved before anything severe happens to them!!

## Solution

Therefore, we are here with a platform that can help one get acquainted with the probable diseases that they might be suffering from, with the help of their symptoms and a few other parameters.  
NaviDoc will also inform the user about what kind of doctors they should be consulting when they are under some physical/mental pain or stress. Not only that but, it will also help the user in navigating to the _nearest doctor with appropriate specialty._

### Tech Stack

_JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Figma and REST APIs_
